# Web Development with Elixir

Are you interested in web development? Seen Erlang and
Elixir around and want to know what the fuss is about?
Well, read along to learn how to apply Elixir for use
in web development!

Follow with me as well explore using Elixir for web
development, and we will figure out how to leverage
the Erlang VM to do our bidding at the same time.

We are primarily going to focus on using a small and
by no means exhaustive set of libraries to cover
these topics:

- Getting started
- Routing
- Templating
- Middleware
- Working with data sources
- Hosting
- ...and more!
